6;:30pm
started to work on save image file, Now i looked on stack over of how to 
save images and the urllib methond seemed to be most common way, my issue was 
that they hard coded the url before to downlaod the image so I am hoping that the image_msg well be engought for it 
to acsess it then put in the image path

 This is the code that makes no sense but just works, so I went to lab 9 for reffernece of how to do it.
